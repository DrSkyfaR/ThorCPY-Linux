# ThorCPY Linux

> **This is a Linux fork of [ThorCPY](https://github.com/theswest/ThorCPY) by [the_swest](https://github.com/theswest).
> All credit for the original project goes to [theswest](https://github.com/theswest).

**ThorCPY Linux** is a Linux-optimised fork of [ThorCPY](https://github.com/theswest/ThorCPY) — a multi-window Scrcpy launcher designed for the **AYN Thor** handheld.

It launches two scrcpy windows (one per display), supports window docking on X11, and provides wireless ADB connection support.
Designed for screensharing, recording or livestreaming.

## Features

- **Dual-screen support** built for the AYN Thor (Display 0 + Display 4)
- **X11 Docking** — embed both scrcpy windows into a single container window
- **Wayland Support** — floating window mode (docking not possible on Wayland)
- **Wireless ADB Connection** — native in-app overlay, no separate window (Android 11+ pairing supported)
- **Network Scanner** — auto-discover Android devices on your local network
- **Layout Presets** — save and restore screen positions
- **Screenshot capture** — capture both screens into one image
- **Scale control** — adjust scrcpy output resolution in real time
- **Swap screens** — flip which display is top/bottom
- **Per-display FPS** — top display runs at 120 FPS, bottom at 60 FPS
- **Wireless optimisation** — automatically reduces FPS and applies settings when connected over WiFi

Technical features:
- Automatic `adb`/`scrcpy` installation via package manager (pacman / apt)
- Thread-safe window management
- Graceful error handling and shutdown
- Comprehensive logging with daily rotation

---

## Requirements

### System
- **OS**: Linux with X11 (recommended) or Wayland (floating mode)
- **Python**: 3.8–3.13 (3.14 not yet supported — pygame has no wheel for it)
- **Device**: AYN Thor with USB Debugging enabled

### System Dependencies

```bash
# Arch Linux / Manjaro / CachyOS
sudo pacman -S android-tools scrcpy python-pygame python-xlib

# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install adb scrcpy python3-dev python3-xlib python3-pygame
```

> **Note:** `python3-pygame` may not be available in older Debian/Ubuntu releases.
> In that case install via pip after installing the system deps above:
> ```bash
> pip install pygame>=2.6.0
> ```

### Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` installs:
- `pygame>=2.6.0` — UI rendering
- `python-xlib>=0.33` — X11 window management (Linux only)

> ThorCPY can also attempt to install `adb` and `scrcpy` automatically on first launch
> if they are missing (via `pkexec`).

---

## Enable USB Debugging

Before connecting your AYN Thor:

1. On the device go to **Settings > About device**
2. Tap **Build number** seven times to enable Developer Options
3. Go to **Settings > System > Developer Options**
4. Enable **USB Debugging**

---

## Installation

### Option 1: Run from Source (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DrSkyfaR/ThorCPY-Linux.git
cd ThorCPY-Linux/

# 2. Install system dependencies (see Requirements above)

# 3. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run ThorCPY
python3 main.py
```

### Option 2: Build a Standalone Executable

```bash
# 1. Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# 2. Run the build script
python build.py

# 3. Find your binary in dist/ThorCPY
# The executable must be placed in a folder containing: bin/, config/, logs/
```

---

## Connecting Your Device

### Via USB (Automatic)
Connect your AYN Thor via USB with USB Debugging enabled. ThorCPY detects the device automatically on startup.

### Via WiFi (Wireless ADB)

Click the **CONNECT** button in the control panel to open the wireless connection overlay.
The button turns **green** when a wireless connection is active.

#### First-time Pairing (Android 11+)

1. On the device: **Developer Options > Wireless debugging > Pair device with pairing code**
2. Note the IP address, pairing port, and 6-digit code shown
3. In ThorCPY, click **CONNECT** → switch to the **First Time Pairing** tab
4. Enter the IP address, pairing port, and 6-digit code, then click **Pair**
5. After pairing, switch to **Quick Connect**, enter the IP with port `5555`, then click **Connect**

#### Subsequent Connections

1. Enable **Wireless debugging** in Developer Options
2. Click **CONNECT** in ThorCPY → **Quick Connect** tab
3. Enter the device IP and port `5555`, click **Connect**

#### Legacy TCP/IP Mode (Android 10 and below)

1. Connect via USB first
2. Run: `adb tcpip 5555`
3. Disconnect USB, then use **Quick Connect** in ThorCPY

## Usage

The ThorCPY control panel appears on the right side of your screen:

| Control | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Global Scale** | Adjust resolution scale of scrcpy output (requires restart) |
| **Top X / Top Y** | Move top screen position |
| **Bottom X / Bottom Y** | Move bottom screen position |
| **CONNECT** | Open wireless connection overlay (green when connected wirelessly) |
| **DOCK WINDOWS** | Embed both windows into a single container (X11 only) |
| **UNDOCK WINDOWS** | Separate into independent floating windows |
| **SCREENSHOT** | Capture the docked view to clipboard |
| **SAVE** | Save current layout as a named preset |
| **LOAD** | Apply a saved preset |
| **DEL** | Delete a saved preset |

---

## Configuration

### Layout Presets — `config/layout.json`

```json
{
    "Default": {
        "tx": 0,
        "ty": 0,
        "bx": 251,
        "by": 648,
        "global_scale": 0.6
    },
    "Streaming": {
        "tx": 100,
        "ty": 50,
        "bx": 300,
        "by": 700,
        "global_scale": 0.3
    }
}
```

### General Config — `config/config.json`

```json
{
    "global_scale": 0.6,
    "tx": 0,
    "ty": 0,
    "bx": 251,
    "by": 648,
    "layout_mode": "DUAL",
    "swap_screens": false,
    "wireless_connect_ip": "192.168.1.100",
    "wireless_connect_port": "5555"
}
```

### Logging

Logs are saved to `logs/` with daily rotation:

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `thorcpy_YYYYMMDD.log` | Main application log |
| `scrcpy_top_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` | Top window scrcpy output |
| `scrcpy_bottom_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` | Bottom window scrcpy output |

To increase verbosity, change `logging.INFO` to `logging.DEBUG` in `main.py`.

## Troubleshooting

### Device Not Found
- Ensure USB Debugging is enabled
- Try a different USB cable (data cable, not charge-only)
- Revoke USB debugging authorizations and reconnect:
  **Settings > System > Developer Options > Revoke USB debugging authorizations**
- Check if ADB sees the device: `adb devices`
- Restart ADB server: `adb kill-server && adb start-server`

### Scrcpy Not Starting
- Confirm scrcpy is installed: `which scrcpy`
- Try running manually: `scrcpy -s YOUR_DEVICE_SERIAL --display-id=0`
- Check logs in `logs/` for error details
- Ensure your device has display IDs `0` and `4`

### Windows Won't Dock (X11)
- Confirm you are running under **X11**, not Wayland: `echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE`
- Wait a few seconds for scrcpy to fully initialise
- Toggle Dock / Undock several times
- Restart ThorCPY

### Running on Wayland
- Docking is **not supported** on Wayland (no window reparenting)
- Windows will open as independent floating windows — this is expected behaviour
- To use X11, start your session with an X11 display server or use `XWayland`

### Wireless Connection Fails
- Ensure both PC and device are on the same WiFi network
- Disable any firewall rules blocking port 5555
- For Android 11+, use the **First Time Pairing** flow before attempting Quick Connect
- Check that **Wireless debugging** is enabled on the device (not just USB debugging)

### Performance / Stuttering
- Over WiFi: ThorCPY automatically uses 120 FPS (top) / 60 FPS (bottom)
- Reduce **Global Scale** in the UI to lower resolution and bandwidth
- Use a USB 3.0 port when connecting via cable for best performance
- Close other resource-intensive applications
- To manually adjust FPS limits, edit `DEFAULT_MAX_FPS` in `src/scrcpy_manager.py`

### Layout Issues
- Delete `config/layout.json` and `config/config.json` to reset to defaults
- Reload at 0.6 scale, adjust, and save
